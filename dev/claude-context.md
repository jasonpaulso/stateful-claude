# Claude Context - Stateful Claude Framework

## Purpose

This file stores session information between Claude Code sessions to provide context for future conversations. Before closing a session, key progress, decisions, and context should be added here to maintain continuity in the next session. Sessions should be added to the log like a journal. Previous sessions should be retained by default.

## Session History

### Session 1: July 16, 2025
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Feature development and framework improvement

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Problem Analysis**: Identified roadmap duplication issue in progress.md updates
2. **Template Enhancement**: Added structured roadmap sections to prevent duplication
3. **Framework Dogfooding**: Created stateful claude instance for this project

#### Key Findings:
- Roadmap duplication occurs when Claude appends instead of updating in-place
- Clear section ownership prevents confusion about what to update vs append
- Self-hosting the framework validates its real-world effectiveness

#### Decisions Made:
- Split roadmaps into "Current Roadmap" (update) and "Roadmap History" (archive)
- Add explicit HTML comments with update instructions in templates
- Create /dev folder to dogfood our own framework

#### Session Outcome:
- Successfully resolved roadmap duplication issue
- Framework now has its own stateful instance
- Added framework-purpose.md to dev folder for complete context
- Ready for advanced feature development and community building

**Template Usage Instructions:**
1. Replace `{PROJECT_NAME}` with your project name
2. Replace `{DATE}` with actual session dates (YYYY-MM-DD format recommended)
3. Fill in session details as they occur
4. Keep sessions as separate, independent entries
5. Preserve all historical sessions for context continuity
