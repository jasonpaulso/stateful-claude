## Current Roadmap
<!-- ALWAYS UPDATE THIS SECTION - DO NOT APPEND NEW ROADMAPS -->
<!-- Replace existing roadmap items when plans change -->

### Next Session Priorities
1. Create advanced usage examples and case studies
2. Develop community contribution guidelines
3. Optimize framework for large project performance

### Upcoming Milestones
- Advanced examples documentation - End of July 2025
- Community guidelines and contribution process - August 2025
- Framework v2.0 with performance optimizations - September 2025

### Issues to Address
- Need more real-world testing with diverse project types
- Template customization could be more streamlined
- Large projects may need file organization strategies

## Roadmap History
<!-- Archive old roadmaps here when major changes occur -->
<!-- Format: ### Roadmap {DATE} - {REASON_FOR_CHANGE} -->

## Session Log

### Session 1 (July 16, 2025)
**Accomplished**:
- Created stateful claude instance for the framework itself (dogfooding!)
- Improved roadmap management to prevent duplication issues
- Added structured "Current Roadmap" and "Roadmap History" sections

**Current State**: 
- Framework is 75% complete and actively being used
- Core templates functional and tested
- Ready for advanced feature development

**Technical Implementation Notes**:
- Templates now have clear update vs append guidance
- Roadmap duplication prevention through structured sections
- Self-hosting approach validates framework effectiveness

**Template Usage Instructions:**
1. Replace all `{PLACEHOLDER}` values with project-specific information
2. Update completion percentages as progress is made
3. Add new sessions to the Session Log as they occur
4. Customize component categories based on your project type
5. Use checkboxes to track actual completion status
6. Update "Last Updated" date with each significant change
